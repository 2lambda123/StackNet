 *
 *<p> This package will hold the main objects to hold data in KazAnova. What should be highlighted is that (to the extend that is possible) everything
 * will be based in single arrays of double which is tested to be (much) faster of all the non-primitive types and list-of-lists format. The matrix to 
 * consider will be:
 * <ol>
 * <li>fsmatrix (fix size matrix) </li>
 * <li>smatrix (sparse matrix) </li>
 * </ol>
 *  </p>
