/**
 * This package contains A version of int-int hash map (and some other maps based on this )
 * Information has been retrieved from : https://github.com/mikvor and comes with 
 * a <a href="http://unlicense.org/" >Unlicense</a>. While testing internally , it 
 * was found very efficient hence it was preferred than other hash-map implementations. 
 * Then a similar logic was used for (this author's) StringIntMap, although it may be be 100% safe,
 * it provided a quickness for the purposes it was used. This is better to remain for internal use only.
